**Status:** In Testing - Issues Being Identified

## Implementation Overview

Driver Maintenance was implemented following the Agent Maintenance template pattern with:
- Full CRUD operations
- Address management
- Contact management
- Comment management
- Search with autocomplete
- New driver creation flow

## üî¥ ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Issue #1: Search Not Working - Autocomplete Not Initializing
**Reported:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Priority:** HIGH

**Description:**
User types in driver search field but autocomplete dropdown does not appear. No suggestions shown even though drivers exist in database.

**Expected Behavior:**
- User enters driver key or name in search field
- Autocomplete suggests matching drivers
- Form submission loads selected driver

**Actual Behavior:**
- User types in search field
- Nothing happens - no dropdown appears
- Autocomplete completely non-functional

**Root Cause:**
**Missing JavaScript file includes in driver_maintenance.php view**

The view was missing these required script tags:
```html
<script src="<?= base_url('js/tls-autocomplete.js') ?>"></script>
<script src="<?= base_url('js/tls-form-tracker.js') ?>"></script>
```

Without these files loaded, the `TLSAutocomplete.init()` call on line 616 was failing silently because `TLSAutocomplete` object was undefined.

**Solution:**
Added the two required script tags before the inline `<script>` block that initializes the components.

**Files Changed:**
- `app/Views/safety/driver_maintenance.php` - Added lines 592-594

**Testing Required:**
- [ ] Verify autocomplete dropdown appears when typing
- [ ] Verify autocomplete shows driver suggestions
- [ ] Verify selecting a driver loads the record
- [ ] Verify "Include Inactive" checkbox works
- [ ] Verify form tracker detects changes

### Issue #2: Autocomplete Initialization Incorrect
**Reported:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Priority:** HIGH

**Description:**
Even after adding JS file includes, autocomplete still didn't work. JavaScript console would show `TLSAutocomplete.init is not a function`.

**Root Cause:**
**Incorrect initialization pattern - TLSAutocomplete is a class, not a static object**

The view was trying to initialize with:
```javascript
TLSAutocomplete.init({ apiUrls: { drivers: '...' } });
```

But TLSAutocomplete is a class that needs to be instantiated:
```javascript
new TLSAutocomplete(inputElement, apiType, callbackFunction);
```

Additionally, the checkbox ID was `include_inactive` but the autocomplete code expects `includeInactive` (camelCase).

**Solution:**
1. Changed initialization to create new instance of TLSAutocomplete class
2. Changed checkbox ID from `include_inactive` to `includeInactive` to match TLSAutocomplete expectations
3. Added callback function to auto-submit form when driver selected

**Files Changed:**
- `app/Views/safety/driver_maintenance.php` - Lines 618-632 (initialization), Line 94 (checkbox ID)

**Testing Required:**
- [ ] Verify autocomplete dropdown appears when typing
- [ ] Verify autocomplete shows driver suggestions
- [ ] Verify selecting a driver auto-submits form and loads driver
- [ ] Verify "Include Inactive" checkbox works

---

### Issue #3: TLSFormTracker Initialization Error
**Reported:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Priority:** HIGH

**Description:**
JavaScript console error: `TLSFormTracker.init is not a function`. This error was preventing the autocomplete from initializing because the script execution stopped at the error.

**Root Cause:**
**Same pattern as Issue #2 - TLSFormTracker is also a class, not a static object**

The view was trying to initialize with:
```javascript
TLSFormTracker.init('driver-form');
```

But TLSFormTracker is a class that needs to be instantiated:
```javascript
new TLSFormTracker({ formSelector: '#driver-form', ... });
```

**Solution:**
Changed initialization to create new instance of TLSFormTracker class with proper configuration options.

**Files Changed:**
- `app/Views/safety/driver_maintenance.php` - Lines 613-632 (form tracker initialization)

**Impact:**
This error was **blocking all subsequent JavaScript from executing**, including the TLSAutocomplete initialization. This is why the autocomplete never worked - the script stopped executing at the TLSFormTracker error before reaching the autocomplete code.

**Testing Required:**
- [ ] Verify no JavaScript errors in console
- [ ] Verify autocomplete initializes and works
- [ ] Verify form change tracking works

---

### Issue #4: TLSFormTracker "Form not found" Warning
**Reported:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Priority:** LOW

**Description:**
Console warning: "TLS Form Tracker: Form not found" appears on initial page load.

**Root Cause:**
Form tracker was being initialized even when no driver was loaded. The `#driver-form` element only exists after a driver is selected/loaded, so on the initial search screen (no driver), the form doesn't exist yet.

**Solution:**
Wrapped TLSFormTracker initialization in PHP conditional: `<?php if ($driver): ?>` so it only initializes when a driver is loaded.

**Files Changed:**
- `app/Views/safety/driver_maintenance.php` - Lines 615-633 (conditional form tracker initialization)

**Impact:**
Minor - just a console warning, didn't affect functionality. Now resolved.

## üìù Notes

### Database Conventions:
- EndDate = '1899-12-30' or NULL = Active driver
- EndDate != '1899-12-30' = Inactive driver
- ACTIVE column NOT reliable - use EndDate

### Stored Procedures:
- `spDriver_Get` - Get driver by DriverKey (33 parameters returned)
- `spDriver_Save` - Save driver (33 parameters)
- `spDriverNameAddresses_Get` - Get NameKeys for driver
- `spDriverNameAddresses_Save` - Link driver to address

### Table Structure:
- `tDriver` - Main driver table
- `tDriver_tNameAddress` - Junction: Driver ‚Üí Address
- `tNameAddress_tContact` - Junction: Address ‚Üí Contact
- `tDriver_tComment` - Junction: Driver ‚Üí Comment
